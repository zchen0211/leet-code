/*
I have put detailed explanation in the comments. A vector<vector<int>> is used for the Excel. Here I just want to highlight two things.

When a cell changes, all the sum related have to update. So a forward link from a cell to all the cells with it in the sum is required. Because a cell may be used for multiple times in the sum due to overlapping ranges, unordered_map<cell, unordered_map<cell, weight>> is used. The weight could improve the efficiency in the worst case.
When reset a cell's value, or reassign a new sum range to it, the cells contribute to its sum will change. So a backward link from this cell to all those cells is necessary. unordered_map<cell, unordered_set<cell>> is sufficient.
The excel is small, at most 26 by 26. So we can use row*26+col as the key of a cell, which is int.
See the code below.
